Goal
===
The objectif of this projet is to create a web site that integrate different concepts of developpement by using java/j2ee frameworks.

After i will show step by step how to do that from scratch.

I want also to use best practices methods and write units tests (using tests frameworks like easyMock/Mockito).

Also, i will integrate my application in sonar so as to mesure code quality and coverage tests
